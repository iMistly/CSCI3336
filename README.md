# CSCI3336 - Divya Bajaj
## Organization of Programming Languages

In this class, we learn about various programming languages and their various quirks through:
* Student-led, programming language-specific presentations 
* Instructor-led general information lectures
* Personal research

This repository was created to track and archive our Haskell language. Unfortunately, I created it too late in the semester, so there are not many commits showing the timeline.

If you would like to run this for youself you will need to download [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup).

```
cd 'my language'
ghci Evaluator.hs
```

and then view examples by typing e1, e2, etc.
```
ghci> e1
ghci> e2
ghci> p1
ghci> p2
ghci> p3
ghci> p4
```

you can quit via
```
ghci> :q
```
