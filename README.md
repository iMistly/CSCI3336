# CSCI3336 - Divya Bajaj
## Organization of Programming Languages

In this class, we learn about various programming languages and their various quirks through:
* Student-led, programming language-specific presentations 
* Instructor-led general information lectures
* Personal research

This repository was created to track and archive our Haskell language. Unfortunately, I created it too late in the semester, so there are not many commits showing the timeline.
